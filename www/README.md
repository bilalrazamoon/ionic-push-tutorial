# ionic-starter-push
A starter application with push notification functionality. 

**Note:** There's a newer, better guide to getting started with Ionic Push [here](http://docs.ionic.io/v1.0/docs/push-from-scratch)

## Installation
Just run:

`ionic start myApp push` 

`cd myApp`

`ionic upload` 

Once your app is uploaded, find it on apps.ionic.io and replace the relevent lines at the top of `/www/js/app.js` with your app ID and API key.

Congrats, you're running Ionic Push!
